# Franka Control PC Setup Guide

This guide describes how to setup the software for the computer to specifically control the Franka Robot Arm. It assumes that the [control pc ubuntu setup guide](./control_pc_ubuntu_setup_guide.md) was successfully completed.

## Setting Up the Robot
If this is the first time you are using the robot, please follow the Franka Robot Setup instructions located in the booklet that accompanies the robot and set the username and password for the robot. 

## Editing the Ethernet Network Configuration
1. Insert the ethernet cable from the Franka Control box to the Control PC.
2. Turn on the Franka Control box.
3. Go to Edit Connections in the Ubuntu Network Connections Menu.
4. Select the Ethernet connection that corresponds to the port that you plugged the ethernet cable into and then click edit.
5. Go to the IPv4 Settings Tab and switch from Automatic (DHCP) to Manual.
6. Add an address of 172.16.0.1 with netmask 24 and then click save.
7. Check to see if you can ping 172.16.0.2 from any terminal.
8. If any issues arise, refer to here: https://frankaemika.github.io/docs/troubleshooting.html#robot-is-not-reachable 

## Entering Franka Desk
