# v55 Release Notes and Upgrade Guide

## Upgrading
### From Any Version
You will always get the cleanest experience by deleting your Assets/Oculus/Voice directory between updates, but it shouldn't be required.

### From <v55
It is required that you delete your existing 'Assets/Oculus/Voice/Demo' directory before making this upgrade in order to remove the previous samples that may conflict with the newly updated samples.  As always deleting the Oculus/Voice directory before upgrading will provide the smoothest experience.

### From <v49
It is recommended that you delete your existing Assets/Oculus/Voice directory before making this upgrade (especially if coming from one of the standalone packages). Simply installing the package should work and the Oculus cleanup tools will remove old files. As of v49 we made a change to update our namespaces to match the new Meta branding. This means any code references you may have had to Voice SDK will need to have their using statements updated.
